## Description
I have developed a command-line application for efficient management of a company's employee database. The back end of the application was developed using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. To initiate the application, the user must execute the following command:

    node index.js

## Installation
***Requirments to have installed***

- MYSQL
- Node.js
- NPMs:
- Inquirer
- Mysql2
- Console.table
- Figlet
- Gradient-string


### _Installation Steps:_

  1. Create an empty folder.

  2. Copy the code from the repository.

  3. Open the terminal and clone the repository using the copied code:
    [`git clone git@github.com: git@github.com:skye143/People_tracker_12.git`](https://github.com/skye143/People_tracker_12)

  4. Use the following code to change the origin's URL of your remote repository
    - git remote set-url origin http://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO

5. Now you can install the npm's using the following lines of code:
      - npm init -y
      - npm i
6. You can now use the application by entering the following into your terminal:
    - node index.js or npm start (If you made that start script in your package.json)

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  |  [Inquirer^](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)  |  [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)

*Once Installed:*
1. Clone the Repository on to your machine.
2. Open the terminal and ensure you are in the right file path.
3. Run the command npm install to download the packages.
4. Then run the command node index.js to run the software.
5. The command prompt will begin on your terminal
